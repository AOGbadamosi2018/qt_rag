## Description

  

### What is Quickteller?


Quickteller is a versatile online payment platform designed to simplify financial transactions for individuals and businesses. It allows users to perform a wide range of activities, such as:

Airtime Recharge: Easily top up your mobile phone.
Funds Transfer: Send money to other accounts.
Bill Payments: Pay for utilities, cable TV, internet subscriptions, and more.
Purchases: Buy flight tickets, pay for events, and shop online.

The platform is managed by Interswitch Nigeria Limited and is accessible via mobile apps, web browsers, and ATMs. Itâ€™s known for its user-friendly interface and extensive network of over 8,000 billers


### Business Problem

The company just released a new version of the app,improving several features and radically changing the UI. Both new and returning users have a lot of questions, this has led to customer support personnel being overwhelmed. 

In addition, some of the old users are having issues logging back into their accounts while a lot of the new users have questions about the apps features. 

This application was created to answer user queries based on two faq documents.

1. [The general company FAQ](https://www.interswitchgroup.com/faq/faq.html)
2. [The new app's FAQ](https://rebirth.quickteller.com/portal/faq/personal/)
  

### Prerequisites

- Docker

- Docker Compose

- Python 3.9+

  

## Installation

  

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

  

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/A0Gbadamosi2024/financial_app_qabot.git

cd project_isw/app
```


2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

```

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

```

- On windows
```
source venv\Scripts\activate
```


3. Install the required dependencies for the virtual environment(sentence transformers may require significant space):

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

  

#### Set Up Docker Compose

- Follow this [link](./setup-docs/docker-compose-installation-guide.md) to install `docker-compose`

  

## Usage


#### 0. Create a new ".env" file inside the "app" folder and copy the following details into it. - remember to add your open-ai-key

```
# PostgreSQL Configuration
POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=course_assistant
POSTGRES_USER=your_username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
 
# Elasticsearch Configuration
# PostgreSQL Configuration
POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=course_assistant
POSTGRES_USER=your_username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
 
# Elasticsearch Configuration
ELASTIC_URL_LOCAL=http://localhost:9200
ELASTIC_URL=http://elasticsearch:9200
ELASTIC_PORT=9200
 
# Ollama Configuration
OLLAMA_PORT=11434
 
# Streamlit Configuration
STREAMLIT_PORT=8501
 
# Other Configuration
MODEL_NAME=all-mpnet-base-v2
INDEX_NAME=course-questions
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'add_your_key'
```

  

#### 1. Start the docker-compose

- Make sure that you've access to run **`docker-compose`**

- Open a terminal and run the following

##### On Linux/Mac:

```

docker-compose up --build

```

  

##### On Windows:

Ensure Docker Desktop is installed. Open a terminal and run:

```

docker-compose up --build

```


* Don't close the terminal

#### 2. Confirm that the containers are running

  

-  ##### Via Docker Desktop

  

If you're using `Docker Desktop`, open it and make sure all the below containers are up and running.

  

1. grafana

2. postgres

3. elastic-search

4. Ollama

  

-  ##### Via Command line (lists all the docker containers)
Open another terminal and execute the below command.

```

docker ps -a

```

 - Copy the Ollama docker container id then run

'''
docker exec it <ollama_container> pull phi3
'''


## Ingesting the base 

#### (Optional) Manual Ingestion of data
> *Note:* 1. Remember to change the json file paths to the actual path the "isw_rebirth_faq_document.json" file is located.
> *Note:* 2. Run the prep.py file only after the docker containers are up and active.

 Run the following command in a terminal with your virtual environment activated and the location where the "prep.py" file is located.

- Below command will start creating the embeddings and pushing the vectors to elasticsearch.
```
python3 prep.py
```
or 

```
python prep.py

```

### Pull the LLM model through Ollama(may not be necessary since it is already done from the DockerFile)

- Exec into Ollama docker container to pull the required model.
> *Note:* As part of this project, I have used `phi3`. We try to pull the same using Ollama.

```
docker exec -it <Ollama-Container-ID> bash
```
```
ollama pull phi3
```


  
### Accessing the app

Once you're sure the setup is done. Visit the streamlit app on the exposed port specified in the docker compose file:

- On your favorite browser visit http://localhost:8501.
- - On your favorite browser visit http://localhost:3000. For the graphana app

- Upon visiting the page, you should see below screen.

![App UI screen](add link to app UI screen setup here)

  

### Accessing Grafana Monitoring Dashboard

> *Note*: Seen issue while accessing Grafana dashboard on Chrome. Please try different browsers if you get `Unauthorzied` error.

- On your favorite browser visit http://localhost:3000

- Upon visiting the page, if you're asked to enter credentials, it's defaulted to below ones:

```

username: admin

password: admin

```

Give a new password also as `admin`

- Once you successfully authenticate, you'll be taken to homescreen like this:


  

- On the left panel, click on `Dashboards` -> `My custom Grapana page`

- Your monitoring dashboard should look like this

>  *Note*: At first, there will be no data. As you begin using the app, all the monitoring dashboards will start to update.
